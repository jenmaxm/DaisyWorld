Shows the regulation of the temperature of the planet 
when only black daisies are present.

The temperature initially increases as the 
black daisies heat the planet. After a while the temperature 
decreases again as the planet is too hot and so the 
daisies die off which result in less absorption of the 
light allowing the planet to cool itself down.
