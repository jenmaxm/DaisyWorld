This graph is a parabolic function. 

It reaches a maximum around (295,0.7) where 295 is 
the temperature and 0.7 is the area as a decimal out of 1.

As the temperature increases so does the area until the 
maximum point where after this point it starts to decrease. 
This is due to the fact the daisies will be unable to grow past 
this temperature as it will be too hot for them to grow. 
This will overall decrease the area of the daisies until it is zero.

The growth of the daisies is the best between around 290 and 300 as 
it is the most stable between these points as 
this is when the graph is the least steep.
