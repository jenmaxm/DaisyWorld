The white daisies have a higher albedo and so a higher reflectivity, so they 
can survive in higher temperatures.

The black daisies become extinct first, leaving 
the white daisies as the only species alive on the planet.

The planet then becomes too hot for the white daisies as well, and they also die out.
As the population of both species of daisies increase, the 
area of bare ground and the area for new daisies decreases.
