As the luminosity increases the temperature of 
the black daisies will also increase.

This is because black daisies have a low albedo and 
don't reflect sunlight very well.
They instead absorb sunlight. This leads to them 
gaining heat from the sunlight which gives off 
solar energy and heat resulting in the temperature to increase.

As the luminosity increases so will the temperature of the black daisies.
