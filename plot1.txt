As the luminosity increases, so does the temperature of the planet.
This is because of the fact that the sun radiates light and heat, or 
solar energy which in turn causes an increase in temperature.
However, since there are no species alive on the planet there is 
no way to cool the planet down. 
If white daisies were present they could reflect this 
luminosity back but there are no daisies in this model so 
the temperature stays increasing. 
They are somewhat proprtional as luminosity increases so does the temperature.
