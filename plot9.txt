Shows the regulation of the temperature of the planet 
when only white daisies are present.

The temperature initially decreases as the white daisies 
cool down the planet. After a while the temperatrure increases 
again as the planet is too cold and so the daisies die off which 
result in less reflection of the light and more absorption of 
the heat from the bare ground allowing the planet to warm itself up.
